	abstract = {In this paper, an optimization-based approach to construct spiking networks for the purposes of decoding and control is presented. Specifically, we postulate a simple objective function wherein a network of interacting, primitive spiking units is decoded in order to drive a linear system along a prescribed trajectory. The units are assumed to spike only if doing so will decrease a specified objective function. The optimization gives rise to an emergent network of neurons with diffusive dynamics and a threshold-based spiking rule that bears resemblance to the Integrate and Fire neural model.},

	abstract = {Two observations about the cortex have puzzled neuroscientists for a long time. First, neural responses are highly variable. Second, the level of excitation and inhibition received by each neuron is tightly balanced at all times. Here, we demonstrate that both properties are necessary consequences of neural networks that represent information efficiently in their spikes. We illustrate this insight with spiking networks that represent dynamical variables. Our approach is based on two assumptions: We assume that information about dynamical variables can be read out linearly from neural spike trains, and we assume that neurons only fire a spike if that improves the representation of the dynamical variables. Based on these assumptions, we derive a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that is able to implement arbitrary linear dynamical systems. We show that the membrane voltage of the neurons is equivalent to a prediction error about a common population-level signal. Among other things, our approach allows us to construct an integrator network of spiking neurons that is robust against many perturbations. Most importantly, neural variability in our networks cannot be equated to noise. Despite exhibiting the same single unit properties as widely used population code models (e.g. tuning curves, Poisson distributed spike trains), balanced networks are orders of magnitudes more reliable. Our approach suggests that spikes do matter when considering how the brain computes, and that the reliability of cortical representations could have been strongly underestimated.},

These networks exhibit single-neuron variability and tuning curves as typically observed in cortex, but paradoxically coincide with a precise, non-redundant spike-based population code. However, it has remained unclear whether the specific synaptic connectivities required in these networks can be learnt with local learning rules. Here, we show how to learn the required architecture. Using coding efficiency as an objective, we derive spike-timing-dependent learning rules for a recurrent neural network, and we provide exact solutions for the networks’ convergence to an optimal state.

Their wide applicability has encouraged researchers to improve artificial neural networks by investigating the biological brain. Neurological research has significantly progressed in recent years and continues to reveal new characteristics of biological neurons. New technologies can now capture temporal changes in the internal activity of the brain in more detail and help clarify the relationship between brain activity and the perception of a given stimulus. This new knowledge has led to a new type of artificial neural network, the Spiking Neural Network ({SNN}), that draws more faithfully on biological properties to provide higher processing abilities. A review of recent developments in learning of spiking neurons is presented in this paper. First the biological background of {SNN} learning algorithms is reviewed. The important elements of a learning algorithm such as the neuron model, synaptic plasticity, information encoding and {SNN} topologies are then presented. Then, a critical review of the state-of-the-art learning algorithms for {SNNs} using single and multiple spikes is presented. Additionally, deep spiking neural networks are reviewed, and challenges and opportunities in the {SNN} field are discussed.},

	abstract = {The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion {NeuN}-positive cells ("neurons") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion {NeuN}-negative ("nonneuronal") cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          An important problem in computational neuroscience is to understand how networks of spiking neurons can carry out various computations underlying behavior. Balanced spiking networks ({BSNs}) provide a powerful framework for implementing arbitrary linear dynamical systems in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons (Boerlin et al. [1]). However, the classic {BSN} model requires near-instantaneous transmission of spikes between neurons, which is biologically implausible. Introducing realistic synaptic delays leads to an pathological regime known as “ping-ponging”, in which different populations spike maximally in alternating time bins, causing network output to overshoot the target solution. Here we document this phenomenon and provide a novel solution: we show that a network can have realistic synaptic delays while maintaining accuracy and stability if neurons are endowed with conditionally Poisson firing. Formally, we propose two alternate formulations of Poisson balanced spiking networks: (1) a “local” framework, which replaces the hard integrate-and-fire spiking rule within each neuron by a “soft” threshold function, such that firing probability grows as a smooth nonlinear function of membrane potential; and (2) a “population” framework, which reformulates the {BSN} objective function in terms of expected spike counts over the entire population. We show that both approaches offer improved robustness, allowing for accurate implementation of network dynamics with realistic synaptic delays between neurons. Moreover, both models produce positive correlations between similarly tuned neurons, a feature of real neural populations that is not found in the original {BSN}. This work unifies balanced spiking networks with Poisson generalized linear models and suggests several promising avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {Anatomic and physiologic data are used to analyze the energy expenditure on different components of excitatory signaling in the grey matter of rodent brain. Action potentials and postsynaptic effects of glutamate are predicted to consume much of the energy (47\% and 34\%, respectively), with the resting potential consuming a smaller amount (13\%), and glutamate recycling using only 3\%. Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate—an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 {mL}/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with ≤15\% of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {This article conforms to a recent trend of developing an energy-efficient Spiking Neural Network ({SNN}), which takes advantage of the sophisticated training regime of Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) and converts a well-trained {CNN} to an {SNN}. We observe that the existing {CNN}-to-{SNN} conversion algorithms may keep a certain amount of residual current in the spiking neurons in {SNN}, and the residual current may cause significant accuracy loss when inference time is short. To deal with this, we propose a unified framework to equalize the output of the convolutional or dense layer in {CNN} and the accumulated current in {SNN}, and maximally align the spiking rate of a neuron with its corresponding charge. This framework enables us to design a novel explicit current control ({ECC}) method for the {CNN}-to-{SNN} conversion which considers multiple objectives at the same time during the conversion, including accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on different neural network architectures, e.g., {VGG}, {ResNet}, and {DenseNet}, to evaluate the resulting {SNNs}. The benchmark datasets include not only the image datasets such as {CIFAR}-10/100 and {ImageNet} but also the Dynamic Vision Sensor ({DVS}) image datasets such as {DVS}-{CIFAR}-10. The experimental results show the superior performance of our {ECC} method over the state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {Sequences of action potentials, or spikes, carry information in the number of spikes and their timing. Spike timing codes are critical in many sensory systems, but there is now growing evidence that millisecond-scale changes in timing also carry information in motor brain regions, descending decision-making circuits, and individual motor units. Across all of the many signals that control a behavior, how ubiquitous, consistent, and coordinated are spike timing codes? Assessing these open questions ideally involves recording across the whole motor program with spike-level resolution. To do this, we took advantage of the relatively few motor units controlling the wings of a hawk moth, Manduca sexta. We simultaneously recorded nearly every action potential from all major wing muscles and the resulting forces in tethered flight. We found that timing encodes more information about turning behavior than spike count in every motor unit, even though there is sufficient variation in count alone. Flight muscles vary broadly in function as well as in the number and timing of spikes. Nonetheless, each muscle with multiple spikes consistently blends spike timing and count information in a 3:1 ratio. Coding strategies are consistent. Finally, we assess the coordination of muscles using pairwise redundancy measured through interaction information. Surprisingly, not only are all muscle pairs coordinated, but all coordination is accomplished almost exclusively through spike timing, not spike count. Spike timing codes are ubiquitous, consistent, and essential for coordination.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a bioinspired digital liquid-state machine ({LSM}) for low-power very-large-scale-integration ({VLSI})-based machine learning applications. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that employs a bioinspired spike-based learning algorithm for the {LSM}. With the proposed online learning, the {LSM} extracts information from input patterns on the fly without needing intermediate data storage as required in offline learning methods such as ridge regression. The proposed learning rule is local such that each synaptic weight update is based only upon the firing activities of the corresponding presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons without incurring global communications across the neural network. Compared with the backpropagation-based learning, the locality of computation in the proposed approach lends itself to efficient parallel {VLSI} implementation. We use subsets of the {TI}46 speech corpus to benchmark the bioinspired digital {LSM}. To reduce the complexity of the spiking neural network model without performance degradation for speech recognition, we study the impacts of synaptic models on the fading memory of the reservoir and hence the network performance. Moreover, we examine the tradeoffs between synaptic weight resolution, reservoir size, and recognition performance and present techniques to further reduce the overhead of hardware implementation. Our simulation results show that in terms of isolated word recognition evaluated using the {TI}46 speech corpus, the proposed digital {LSM} rivals the state-of-the-art hidden Markov-model-based recognizer Sphinx-4 and outperforms all other reported recognizers including the ones that are based upon the {LSM} or neural networks.},

In order to shed light on the implementation of {LSMs} in digital {CMOS} technologies, we study the trade-offs between hardware overhead (i.e. precision of synaptic weights and membrane voltage and size of the reservoir) and performance. Assisted with theoretical analysis, we leverage the inherent redundancy of the targeted spiking neural networks to achieve both high performance and low hardware cost for the application of speech recognition. In addition, by modeling several types of catastrophic failure and random error, we show that the {LSMs} are generally robust. Using three subsets of the {TI}46 speech corpus to benchmark, we elucidate that in terms of isolated word recognition, the analyzed digital {LSMs} are very promising for future hardware implementation because of their low overhead, good robustness, and high recognition performance.},

The model consists of anatomically organized spiking neurons encompassing premotor, primary motor, and cerebellar cortices. The model proposes novel neural computations within these areas to control a nonlinear three-link arm model that can adapt to unknown changes in arm dynamics and kinematic structure. We demonstrate the mathematical stability of both forms of adaptation, suggesting that this is a robust approach for common biological problems of changing body size (e.g. during growth), and unexpected dynamic perturbations (e.g. when moving through different media, such as water or mud). To demonstrate the plausibility of the proposed neural mechanisms, we show that the model accounts for data across 19 studies of the motor control system. These data include a mix of behavioural and neural spiking activity, across subjects performing adaptive and static tasks. Given this proposed characterization of the biological processes involved in motor control of the arm, we provide several experimentally testable predictions that distinguish our model from previous work.},

	abstract = {Spiking neural networks ({SNNs}) are inspired by information processing in biology, where sparse and asynchronous binary signals are communicated and processed in a massively parallel fashion. {SNNs} on neuromorphic hardware exhibit favorable properties such as low power consumption, fast inference, and event-driven information processing. This makes them interesting candidates for the efficient implementation of deep neural networks, the method of choice for many machine learning tasks. In this review, we address the opportunities that deep spiking networks offer and investigate in detail the challenges associated with training {SNNs} in a way that makes them competitive with conventional deep learning, but simultaneously allows for efficient mapping to hardware. A wide range of training methods for {SNNs} is presented, ranging from the conversion of conventional deep networks into {SNNs}, constrained training before conversion, spiking variants of backpropagation, and biologically motivated variants of {STDP}. The goal of our review is to define a categorization of {SNN} training methods, and summarize their advantages and drawbacks. We further discuss relationships between {SNNs} and binary networks, which are becoming popular for efficient digital hardware implementation. Neuromorphic hardware platforms have great potential to enable deep spiking networks in real-world applications. We compare the suitability of various neuromorphic systems that have been developed over the past years, and investigate potential use cases. Neuromorphic approaches and conventional machine learning should not be considered simply two solutions to the same classes of problems, instead it is possible to identify and exploit their task-specific advantages. Deep {SNNs} offer great opportunities to work with new types of event-based sensors, exploit temporal codes and local on-chip learning, and we have so far just scratched the surface of realizing these advantages in practical applications.},

	abstract = {We have studied neural networks as models for time series forecasting, and our research compares the Box-Jenkins method against the neural network method for long and short term memory series. Our work was inspired by previously published works that yielded inconsistent results about comparative performance. We have since experimented with 16 time series of differing complexity using neural networks. The performance of the neural networks is compared with that of the Box-Jenkins method. Our experiments indicate that for time series with long memory, both methods produced comparable results. However, for series with short memory, neural networks outperformed the Box-Jenkins model. Because neural networks can be easily built for multiple-step-ahead forecasting, they may present a better long term forecast model than the Box-Jenkins method. We discussed the representation ability, the model building process and the applicability of the neural net approach. Neural networks appear to provide a promising alternative for time series forecasting.

            In order to reduce the risk of authorized users being interrupted in the cognitive satellite wireless network, a multi-step prediction approach based on a cascaded forward artificial neural network is proposed to predict user behavior in the designed scenario. This approach uses the powerful learning ability of the cascaded forward network to analyze the historical spectrum occupancy records of licensed users, and then predict the user behavior in the next few time slots. The prediction result can help the base station in the cognitive network to schedule the dynamic access process of the cognitive users, and reduce the interference caused by the cognitive user to the authorized users. Finally, compared with traditional prediction algorithms, it is verified that the proposed multi-step prediction algorithm can effectively reduce the probability of spectrum conflicts.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on {ImageNet} classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Unlike feedforward neural networks, {RNNs} have cyclic connections making them powerful for modeling sequences. They have been successfully used for sequence labeling and sequence prediction tasks, such as handwriting recognition, language modeling, phonetic labeling of acoustic frames. However, in contrast to the deep neural networks, the use of {RNNs} in speech recognition has been limited to phone recognition in small scale tasks. In this paper, we present novel {LSTM} based {RNN} architectures which make more effective use of model parameters to train acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition. We train and compare {LSTM}, {RNN} and {DNN} models at various numbers of parameters and configurations. We show that {LSTM} models converge quickly and give state of the art speech recognition performance for relatively small sized models.},

	abstract = {Various hypotheses of information representation in brain, referred to as neural codes, have been proposed to explain the information transmission between neurons. Neural coding plays an essential role in enabling the brain-inspired spiking neural networks ({SNNs}) to perform different tasks. To search for the best coding scheme, we performed an extensive comparative study on the impact and performance of four important neural coding schemes, namely, rate coding, time-to-first spike ({TTFS}) coding, phase coding, and burst coding. The comparative study was carried out using a biological 2-layer {SNN} trained with an unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) algorithm. Various aspects of network performance were considered, including classification accuracy, processing latency, synaptic operations ({SOPs}), hardware implementation, network compression efficacy, input and synaptic noise resilience, and synaptic fault tolerance. The classification tasks on Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology ({MNIST}) and Fashion-{MNIST} datasets were applied in our study. For hardware implementation, area and power consumption were estimated for these coding schemes, and the network compression efficacy was analyzed using pruning and quantization techniques. Different types of input noise and noise variations in the datasets were considered and applied. Furthermore, the robustness of each coding scheme to the non-ideality-induced synaptic noise and fault in analog neuromorphic systems was studied and compared. Our results show that {TTFS} coding is the best choice in achieving the highest computational performance with very low hardware implementation overhead. {TTFS} coding requires 4x/7.5x lower processing latency and 3.5x/6.5x fewer {SOPs} than rate coding during the training/inference process. Phase coding is the most resilient scheme to input noise. Burst coding offers the highest network compression efficacy and the best overall robustness to hardware non-idealities for both training and inference processes. The study presented in this paper reveals the design space created by the choice of each coding scheme, allowing designers to frame each scheme in terms of its strength and weakness given a designs’ constraints and considerations in neuromorphic systems.},
