\chapter{<Result>}
Describe the results of the degree project.
Analyses of results

How does the optimal network simulate?
Influence of parameters\\
What are the magic parameters? mu etc



The control with optimal works fine too.
Influence of the parameters
Magic number tuning required for x,y,z etc

Learning works fine with magic numbers
Examples.
What works better?
What works worse?
What if I only learn 1 part? What is the bigger error.
Convergence over time usually very bad
Compared to the eigenvalues maybe convergence improves
How do the parameters look? Heatmap
How to judge the accuracy of the closeness of the parameters to the optimal
What is the influence of the input
You have to juggle the values of learning rate and input amplitude to reach ideal results
