\section{Discussion}

Answer the questions of the problem!!!!\\

\subsection{Future Work}
find nonlinearity\\
end point control\\


Further work:\\
Maybe learning methods to control nonlinear dynamic systems\\
Maybe we can even do the adverserial attack to try to screw with the network.\\
Implement this on neuromorphic hardware\\
