\section{Discussion}

Answer the questions of the problem!!!!\\

\subsection{Future Work}

Maybe different noise models.. Brown noise
Adjust the input such that the imbalance can be negated and training is faster.\\
find nonlinearity\\
end point control\\
Test if learning with lower amplitude towards the end can refine the performance even more.\\
\todo{Double rate adjustment. In epoch and overall epochs}

Further work:\\
Maybe learning methods to control nonlinear dynamic systems\\
Maybe we can even do the adverserial attack to try to screw with the network.\\
Implement this on neuromorphic hardware\\
