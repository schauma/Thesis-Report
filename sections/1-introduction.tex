The human brain is a brilliant computing unit comprised of around 86 billion\cite{azevedo_equal_2009} neurons. Each of these neurons can have thousands of connections to other neurons.\addref{Maybe put some exact numbers here and a source}. Between these connections, information travels trough the network as electrical impulses that interact with the neurons own electrical potential. The huge network complex of the human brain is capable of vastly different and intricate tasks.\rewrite{Sounds vague} Yet some problems that are still next to impossible to solve by machines and classical algorithms alone. Moreover many machine implementations lack the speed, precision or flexibility of the human counterpart.\\
Researchers try to remedy this by mimicking the brain's internal network structure to solve problems deemed unsuitable for classic algorithms.\\
A variety of different architectures for these \acp{ANN} have been proposed, with the most prevalent design being a feed-forward network.
In these networks, information travels only in one direction and is not propagated by spikes but gradients usually set in $[0,1]$ or $[-1,1]$.
These \acp{ANN} have made impressive progress in the fields of image recognition, autonomic driving,medical diagnosis\cite{patel_applications_2007} or  \ac{NLP} (using Transformers\cite{vaswani_attention_2017}).\\
This abstract representation bears advantages e.g in modelling and implementation but also gives away some key features of the human brain. Do to the information travelling only towards the output, feed-forward networks cannot build a memory or easily process temporal data. Recurrent models exist which allow for memory \addref{cite some LSTM networks or others} and sequential data input but loose some of the advantages compared to the Feed-Forward due to its increased complexity.\\
A third generation\cite{maass_networks_1997} of network architectures has risen, which aims to be even more biologically plausible. Inspired from nature, they implement spiking behaviour and recurrence found in the human brain.
This newer form of \ac{SNN} is as powerful as the classic feed-forward but suited for temporal data.\\
While state of the art feed-forward networks are still outperforming \acp{SNN}, in some cases modern \acp{SNN} are on par or more performant with older feed-forward implementations. This comes with the added benefit of consuming much less power. Usually deep \acp{ANN} are run on \acp{GPU}, especially for training, in which the energy consumption can exceed 300W for modern chips\footnote{e.g. a NVidia RTX 3090}. The brain however is estimated to only consume about
20W \cite{clarke_circulation_1999} for immense computing capacity. Accompanying the \ac{SNN} with neuromorphic hardware can yield a similar boost in efficiency with processors energy consumption in the pJ per \ac{SOP}\cite{indiveri_importance_2019}.

hile consuming a fraction of the energy using specialized neuromorphic hardware.

\todi{Now list the goal: We want to do it for DS and check how good they are. Then method and then work. Take from below}


They lack in some others\\
Therefore considerable research went into it\\
Now we have spiking neural networks, that imitate the brain even more\\
We hope that with that we have even better performance\\
From very biological to very abstract there have been many proposals\\
Cost performance trade off.\\
Spiking networks have gained similar or exceeding performance compared to the artificial one in some areas-> refs\\
Key advantage is in the temporal dimensional gain.\\
One field they are suited well is the control of dynamic systems\\
In this thesis we use a spiking neural network to control a linear dynamic system\\
The usual way to simulate biological dynamic systems is using LQG control -> ref\\
I believe because of the energy minimization\\
So we can compare them with usual NN and control in terms of performance... i guess\\
We start by giving an intro into spiking neural networks\\
Then spiking neural networks for dynamic systems\\
After control theory with SNN and maybe regular LQG control\\
Lately the learnign of SNNs for the control of dynamic system\\

Further work:\\
Maybe learning methods to control nonlinear dynamic systems\\
Maybe we can even do the adverserial attack to try to screw with the network.\\
Implement this on neuromorphic hardware\\

Problem:\\
Problem is that it is unnatural for classic NN to use temporal data.\\
They usually quantize it and make a big input layer -> ref\\
There are recurrent networks but ... they need to have smth bad as well\\
The LQG control is also not great for some reason I need to find\\
There are many spkiking network archetypes like poisson and GLm and balanced\\
Also problem is that for some spiking networks learning rules could be hard to come by.\\
There are many prospects though as for example ......->refs\\
Also usually learning rules smth of an inverse and that the brain does not have or do I believe arvind said\\



Method:\\
We use a SNN to to control any arbitrary DS\\
Balanced networks show a some key motives seen in the brain like poisson distribution and smth else ->ref\\
The SNN is to be trained with a STDP rule\\
Then compared to optimal weights\\
Then investigated about robustness and other things as many before\\
One part of robustness is trying to get the most essential nodes of the snn to function well.\\¸
Then we have the potential to find a classic nn and train it with that ???\\
With that out of the way we can compare the performance of all the methods.\\
Then we could study the usability for biological interpretation.\\
Maybe even train time over performance or smth whatever\\


Work:\\
Explain the controller method aka what the math of the controller\\
In method explain the balanced and the derivation\\
In work summarize the implementation\\
Same for the conventional NN\\
Summarize the training method\\
Explain and derive the training method in method\\


Results:\\
To everthign mentioned in method for performance and so on\\
Answer the questions of the problem!!!!\\


\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
Present the background for the area. Give the context by explaining the parts that are needed to understand the degree project and thesis. (Still, keep in mind that this is an introductory part, which does not require too detailed description).

Use references\footnote{You can also add footnotes if you want to clarify the content on the same page.}

Detailed description of the area should be moved to Chapter 2, where detailed information about background is given together with related work.


This background presents background to writing a report in latex.

\section{Problem}
NN have excelled at many fields\\
Fields where they are not fit\\ aka temporal data\\
They have ways to compromise on that \\ -> reference\\
Spiking nn inherently temporal \\
more natural choice\\
However they also have problems\\
like the following:::: reference!!\\
\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the degree project/thesis is the purpose of the written material, i.e., the thesis. The thesis presents the work / discusses / illustrates and so on.

It is not “The project is about” even though this can be included in the purpose. If so, state the purpose of the project after purpose of the thesis).

Probably delete as a own paragraph but mention smth like that.

\section{Goal}
The goal means the goal of the degree project. Present following: the goal(s), deliverables and results of the project.\\

The goal of this project is to create a \ac{SNN} that can control \rewrite{give exact specifications. For example controllability} any given linear \ac{DS}. Furthermore should the \ac{NN} be robust against failing neurons or connections to some degree. With this we can investigate to find the smallest \ac{SNN} with acceptable performance.
Its performance should be comparable or supersede conventional control systems, like \ac{LQG} control, or \acp{NN}. We expect better results to conventional \acp{NN} because of the \ac{SNN}'s natural way to use temporal data. For the \ac{SNN} itself we desire similarities to the brain, such as high precision or Poisson distributed spiking.\addref{What do we else want like the brain.Maybe low spike count? And what can we do?  Also References!}
To mimic the brain's learning, we want to use local training rules that are biologically plausible. The network should be converge to the optimal parameters.\rewrite{This is even more to ask than from a conventional NN, Say in method bcs there it has already been proven if I am not mistaken}. This requirement would allow us to give a justified measure on how close we are replicating the brain's control power compared to our artificial implementation in specific circumstances\rewrite{sounds vague}.

Detailed description of these methodologies and methods should be presented in Chapter 3. In chapter 3, the focus could be research strategies, data collection, data analysis, and quality assurance.


We build a SNN for a control problem and check it for performance as mentioned above. In addition we design a conventional controller and compare the result. IF we have the time for it we put a conventional NN to it too. We see the performance compared to the others and look at the specs we mentioned above.
The SNN is trained by learning using STDP rule. We can compare the learned weights with the optimal weights when we have our own optimal controller/ we simulate our trajectory.
For our approach we use a balanced spiking network.
