In this chapter, a detailed description about background of the degree project is presented together with related work. Discuss what is found useful and what is less useful. Use valid arguments.

Explain what and how prior work / prior research will be applied on or used in the degree project /work (described in this thesis). Explain why and what is not used in the degree project and give valid reasons for rejecting the work/research.

Use references!

\section{Dynamic systems}

\section{Neuron model}

\subsection{Biological Neuron model}
The most biologically accurate model of neuron spiking is the \ac{HH} model. The \ac{HH}-model considers the neuron with its ion channels. The membrane acts as a capacitance and the travelling ions in each ion channel contribute a current to the overall membrane potential. These ion gates are voltage dependent and are defined positive in direction out of the cell.\\
A particular ion channel for ion $X$ can be modelled as
\begin{equation}
	I_X= g_X \cdot (V-V_X)
\end{equation}
These currents are summed summed for the different ion channels in question, most commonly for Sodium, Potassium and a leak current. In reality there are a plethora of different channels and channel properties\footnote{See  \url{channelpedia.epfl.ch} for an extensive list}. The $V_X$ are the equilibrium potentials for each of the channels and can be computed using the Nernst equation \cite{johnston_foundations_1995}. \addref{Add a reference to a monography.}
\begin{equation}
	C \frac{dV}{dt} = g_{Na} \cdot (V-V_{Na}) + g_K \cdot (V-V_K) + g_l \cdot (V-V_l)
\end{equation}
Do model the voltage dependency of the ion channels, the conductances are described with gating variables, usually called $n$, $h$ and $g$


\subsection{"IF and LIF"}
The simplest model of neurons are the \ac{IF} and \ac{LIF} neurons.\\
\paragraph{IF Neurons}
\ac{IF} Neurons, as the name implies, integrate the incoming current over time.
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d V(t)}{d t} = \frac{1}{C}I(t)
\end{equation}
The membrane voltage is governed by the incoming current spikes of connected neurons and the membrane capacitance. The neuron potential does not change without a change of input current and thus presents as a perfect integrator of the input.\\
\paragraph{LIF Neurons}
In contrast to that the \ac{LIF} neuron contains a leak term on the RHS which brings the voltage back to its resting potential over time. The model can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\tau\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -(V(t)-E_r) + RI(t),
\end{equation}
where $\tau = RC$ is the time constant the composed of the membrane resistance $R$ and the membrane capacitance $C$ and the resting potential $E_r$. In the absence of input $I(t)$ the voltage settles  on the membrane potential $E_r$.\\
The input $I(t)$ is a the sum of Dirac functions indicating a spiking neuron
\begin{equation}
	I(t) = \sum_k \delta(t-t^k)
\end{equation}
and $t_k$ being the time of the $k$-th spike. When the membrane voltage exceeds the threshold potential $\bar{v}$, a spike is sent out by the neuron and the voltage sets back to its reset voltage $v_{res}$.
\subsection{Izhikevich Neuron}
While the above models deliver a useful and cheap simplification, they lack in accuracy. The Izhikevich model \cite{izhikevich_simple_2003} of the neuron tries be the of both worlds in terms of efficiency and accuracy. It is comprised of 2D ODEs with the membrane potential $v$ as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\frac{d v}{dt} &= 0.04v^2 + 5v + 140 -u +I(t)\\
	\frac{d u}{dt} &= a(bv-u).
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
With the chosen factors, the neuron experiences a spike when $u\geq30 $mV, in which case the neuron resets to
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	u &\leftarrow u+d\\
	v&\leftarrow c
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The parameters describe $a$ scale of recovery, $b$ sensitivity, $c$ the reset potential of $v$ and $d$ the reset of variable $u$.\rewrite{Maybe shitty explanation, which could be extended on.} Depending on these parameters one can achieve different behaviours of the neuron e.g. regular spiking, fast spiking and low threshold spiking to name a few \cite{izhikevich_simple_2003}.

\subsection{Spiking Neural Networks}
A spiking Neural network is one step closer to a biologic representation of a brain. Instead of conveying information using a gradient in conventional \ac{NN}s, information is propagated using discrete spikes of excitation, similar to biological neurons. Hereby one can distinguish between several ideas of implementation.

Balanced networks differ from the previous approaches that they closely track excitation an inhibition. The derivation of its behaviour is adopted from \cite{boerlin_predictive_2013} and \cite{huang_optimizing_2017}.\\
