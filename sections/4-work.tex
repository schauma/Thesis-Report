	\chapter{<The work>}

Describe the degree project. What did you actually do? This is the practical description of how the method was applied.
How do we make the SNN
MAtlab
Balanced spiking network (say why to use that )\\
maybe pseudo code
Ideally some theorem (convergence???)
Simulation? nein kommt in den naechsten part

\section{Writing the balanced network simulation}

\section{Writing the balanced network controller}

\section{The direct approach}


\section{Learning the dynamics}
Write that the most of all the control is pretty picky for parameters.
This means that it is not very versatile.
So instead we want to learn our own parameters so we have adaptability.
Enter in the learning paper of Deneve and Brendel and why it would be nice. It would be nice bcs we can learn the parameters independently and can preserve some structure or the fact that we want to include B matrix somewhere
This doesnt work for some reasons I need to point out.
Then the bourdoukan paper
Then we set this for control.
And results
