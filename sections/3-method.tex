\chapter{<Engineering-related content, Methodologies and Methods>}
% \thispagestyle{fancy}

Describe the engineering-related contents (preferably with models) and the research methodology and methods that are used in the degree project.

Most likely it generally describes the method used in each step to make sure that you can answer the research question.

\section{Engineering-related and scientific content:}
Applying engineering related and scientific skills; modelling, analysing, developing, and evaluating engineering-related and scientific content; correct choice of methods based on problem formulation; consciousness of aspects relating to society and ethics (if applicable).

As mentioned earlier, give a theoretical description of methodologies and methods and how these are applied in the degree project.


was ist meine research question?

zusammensetzung von den beiden systeme: dynamisches system und neuronales netz. mehr oder weniger die herleitung kopieren aus dem paper. Dann mit learning von den gewichten.





Here I describe what how it needs to be done.
So this is the place for the derivation
The concept and the process whatever that means
Later there comes the how I implemented it.
Here is what we needs to be implemented.



Here very detailed explanation of the Balanced network for this problem\\
Very detailed way for the regular NN for this problem
Basics of the controller design used in this comparison aka LQG controller\\
Method of learning the weights for the SNN
Method of comparison\\
