\section{Choice of Network archetecture}
The field of \acp{SNN} is under ongoing research. Therefore many different network types and learning approaches have been proposed e.g. \acp{LSM}. In order to stay biologically more realistic we ignore purely rate based spiking networks as there is evidence that the precise spike timing is relevant in nature\cite{brette_philosophy_2015}\cite{putney_precise_2019}.


Explain choice of SNN architecture\\

Design a LQG controller to start with as reference
First found how to simulate a dynamical system with given input c from Boerlin\\
Then finding the controller structure to find exteral input c to control the system in a desired way\\
Then notice you need to have magic numbers to get it to work properly.\\
Then trying to bring the learning mechanics to that approach.\\
Deemed difficult\\
finding way to control a dynamical system with the learning SNN framework\\
Also not so far to do nonlinear systems\\


Describe the engineering-related contents (preferably with models) and the research methodology and methods that are used in the degree project.

Most likely it generally describes the method used in each step to make sure that you can answer the research question.

\section{Engineering-related and scientific content:}
Applying engineering related and scientific skills; modelling, analysing, developing, and evaluating engineering-related and scientific content; correct choice of methods based on problem formulation; consciousness of aspects relating to society and ethics (if applicable).

As mentioned earlier, give a theoretical description of methodologies and methods and how these are applied in the degree project.


was ist meine research question?

zusammensetzung von den beiden systeme: dynamisches system und neuronales netz. mehr oder weniger die herleitung kopieren aus dem paper. Dann mit learning von den gewichten.





Here I describe what how it needs to be done.
So this is the place for the derivation
The concept and the process whatever that means
Later there comes the how I implemented it.
Here is what we needs to be implemented.



Here very detailed explanation of the Balanced network for this problem\\
Very detailed way for the regular NN for this problem
Basics of the controller design used in this comparison aka LQG controller\\
Method of learning the weights for the SNN
Method of comparison\\
